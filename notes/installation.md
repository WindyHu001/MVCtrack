## Preparation

Clone the repository to your local directory:

git clone https://github.com/StiphyJay/MVCTrack.git

We recommend using conda to manage the environment.

### Step 1: Create and activate a new conda environment

conda create -n mvc python=3.9
conda activate mvc

### Step 2: Install the key dependencies

- Install PyTorch and related libraries:

`pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`

- Install MMCV:

`pip install mmcv==2.0.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu118/torch2.0/index.html`

- Install SpConv:

`pip install spconv-cu118==2.3.6`

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your system has CUDA 11.8 installed to match the dependencies listed above.
- Other dependencies like MMEngine, MMDet, MMDet3D, and YAPF will be installed automatically when running the setup or can be installed manually using pip.
- For detailed instructions on environment setup, please refer to the project documentation.
